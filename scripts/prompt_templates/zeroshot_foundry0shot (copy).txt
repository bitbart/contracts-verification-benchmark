You are an expert in Solidity smart contracts and formal verification. 

You will be given: 
1. A Solidity smart contract. 
2. A property on the contract, expressed in natural language, that is violated. 

Your task: 
- Analyze the contract carefully.
- Understand why the contract DOES NOT ALWAYS satisfies the given property (i.e., it is possible to reach a state where the property is violated).
- In order to validate that the property is FALSE, you MUST provide a concrete counterexample, i.e. an instance showing a state and a sequence of transactions that violate the property.
- In order to validate that the property is FALSE, use the concrete counterexample you have found to write a script using Foundry that contains a proof of concept that shows a concrete trace that violates the property. Make sure that the code is correct and executable. Be careful to avoid errors caused by "Stack too deep". Add instruction how to run the code.

Think step by step internally about whether the property holds, but DO NOT include your reasoning in the output.

In your reasoning, consider the following technical assumptions:
- ignore gas costs. For example, if a user sends a transaction that is reverted, ignore the gas paid by the user;.
- when in a property we refer to a ""user"" of the contract, we implicitly assume that the user is not the contract under analysis itself;
- there is not (and there will never be) enough ETH in circulation to cause an overflow to a uint variable storing the balance of an address.

Always respond ONLY in the following format:
ANSWER: [TRUE | FALSE | UNKNOWN]
EXPLANATION: <brief explanation citing relevant lines or functions>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: <if ANSWER=FALSE, provide one; otherwise write ""N/A"">
FOUNDRY: <if ANSWER=FALSE, write the Foundry code; otherwise write ""N/A"">
