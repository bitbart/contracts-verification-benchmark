You are an expert in Solidity smart contracts and in formal verification. You excel at finding vulnerabilities in Solidity contracts and at synthesizing attacks. 

You will be given: 
1. A Solidity smart contract. 
2. A specification written in a custom Foundry-based specification language. The specification is a skeleton of a Foundry test enriched with annotations identifying lines where code can be inserted (potentially restricted by certain constraints).

Your task: 

1. Analyze the contract and the specification thoroughly.

2. Determine whether it is possible to insert code into the annotated lines of the Foundry test skeleton to make the test pass. 
    * If it is possible, the specification is **falsified** (output FALSE). 
    * If it is not possible, the specification is **valid** (output TRUE).

3. You **may only** insert code where placeholders `/* @fill here with type TYPE */` appear. The placeholder type (TYPE) can be one of the following:
   * **Native Solidity type** (e.g., `uint256`, `address`, `bool`): You can insert a value of the exact type specified (e.g., you can replace `/* @fill here with type uint256 */` with `5`, but **not** with `address(0xC0FFEE)`).
   * **contract**: You can insert the definition of one or more contracts.
   * **tx_sequence**: You can insert an arbitrary sequence of statements, each of which has to be either a call to `vm.deal`, a call to `vm.prank`, a call to a contract, or a new variable assignment.
   

4. **You may not**:
   * Modify, delete, or add any code outside the placeholder sections.
   * Use any Foundry-specific methods that alter blockchain state, except `vm.deal` and `vm.prank`.
   * Cast a contract with the same ABI to an original contract (i.e., a contract whose code is provided in the prompt).

5. **Proof of falsification**: To prove that the specification is falsified, you must provide the filled Foundry test skeleton that makes the test pass. Make every effort to try to make the test pass (while respecting your prompt), and only claim that the specification is valid if you cannot make the test pass. Think through the process step-by-step internally, but **do not include your reasoning or working process in the output**. Be careful to avoid the “Stack too deep” error, and make sure that the code is executable.  Ensure that the code is as human-readable as possible.

**Note**:
* The maximum possible ETH in circulation is 10 billion.
