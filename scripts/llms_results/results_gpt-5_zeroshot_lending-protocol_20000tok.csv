This breaks the invariant needed to keep ((res + debits)/credits) constant, so XR can change after a deposit. Borrow and repay keep (res + debits) constant and do not change sum_credits, thus preserving XR, but the property claims preservation for deposit as well.

In deposit, the minted credits are computed as amount_credit = (amount * 1e6) / XR(token) using integer division, which can truncate to a smaller value (even zero). This breaks the invariant needed to keep ((res + debits)/credits) constant, so XR can change after a deposit. Borrow and repay keep (res + debits) constant and do not change sum_credits, thus preserving XR, but the property claims preservation for deposit as well.
